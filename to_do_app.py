#  Match-case is usually to match a string out of a predefined number of strings (e.g., a series of commands, months of the year, etc.)

# What is the difference between a while loop and a for-loop?
# A while loop iterates as long as the while-condition is True.
# A for-loop iterates that many times as there are items in the list that is being iterated.
# if, elif, else, or, not are Boolean operators
