# For more complex data structures, you can use JSON data with list and dictionaries
# This data can be interpreted by Py using JSON module (import json)
# So JSON module gets the data from this file as simple text
# and it converts into proper data structure.
# That in this case is a list.

# Data type is automatically assigned depending on the first brackets,
# wich could be square brackets or curly brackets.
